# 3D Cellular Automaton in Cinema 4D

## Description

This project is a 3D cellular automaton simulation using Cinema 4D. It aims to visualize the complex dynamics of cells based on specific rules, rendering them as particles in a 3D environment. The script simulates a 3D variant of Conway's Game of Life, with customizable rules for cell birth and survival.

## Features

- 3D cellular automaton simulation.
- Customizable rules for cell birth and survival.
- Visualization of cells as particles in Cinema 4D.


## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to have Cinema 4D installed on your computer. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local directory.
2. Open the Cinema 4D file.
3. Adjust the settings as needed.
4. Start the simulation.

## Usage

You can modify the following settings according to your needs:

- `birth_min`: Minimum number of neighbors for a new cell to be born.
- `birth_max`: Maximum number of neighbors for a new cell to be born.
- `survival_min`: Minimum number of neighbors for a cell to survive.
- `survival_max`: Maximum number of neighbors for a cell to survive.
- `refresh`: Frequency of simulation updates.
